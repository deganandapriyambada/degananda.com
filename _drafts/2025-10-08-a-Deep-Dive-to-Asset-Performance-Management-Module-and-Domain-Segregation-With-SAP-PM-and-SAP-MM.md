# Assets Definition

Asset in context of organization or company is anything that used by these compant to complete work. it can be production machine, car, truck, or even human.

Every asset will have lifecycle just like any beings in this world. For example, during the manufacturing factory setup, organization will plan to acquire new cutting machine.

## Asset Lifecycle

asset acquring process will focus on identifying the engineering requirements in comparison with the business needs (eg: type of cutting machine, the amount of asset needed per site)

# Infrstructure Requirement

there are two common APM server infrastructure provisioning and deployment scenario. Most easy setup is to go fully cloud infrastrucuture (SaaS - software as a services) &mdash; no need to worries about underlying infrastructure installation, networking and management.

Alternatively, some APM also support on premises scenario where the server is hosted on the clients infrastructure. Second scenario is prefered if **data privacy become a critical concern** during the project.

    Most of cloud provider such as AWS, Azure and GCP has strict and bold data policy privacy statement

However, some companies might not fully trusted these data privacy statement (even some are providing guarantee letter). On premises scenario is more viable compared to fully on cloud deployment at this specific cases.

## Sample Infrastructure Requirement on GE

An example on GE APM software, they provide publicly available infrastructure requirement as shown below

| Infastructure Component | Stack Requirement | Hardware Requirement
|------------|------------|------------|

these infrastructure can be deployed **on premises** or **cloud based**

## Main Beneft of APM

each organization which plan to implement APM into their asset management life cycle will expect following benefit

1. **reduced unplanned downtime** (if possible **near zero downtime**)
2. capability to **maintain production rate** as there is no unplanned downtime
3. **reduced maintenance cost**
4. maintain HSSE (Health,safety, security & environment) **compliance**

# APM Key Modules 

below are the common functionality modules which offered by APM.

&mdash; Each APM might have different modules/capabilities, but generally it cover same purpose and overall functionality.
