    Note that only the logo shape will be considerated as final logo input. the text then will be overrided with preferred font familly

### Silhoute logo

below are the 6 logo candidates based brainstorming process with AI. The advantage of AI is they can create the logo in no time eventhough the logo is lack of taste/soul. refining will came next to ingest that soul up.

**Option 1**

![postimage50](/assets/images/2025-10/logoshape2.jpg)
[first logo ideas](/assets/images/2025-10/logoshape2.jpg){: .center-image }

a clock with 8 small circle dots arround it. Quite complex as there are lot of shape. Might look bad on the favicon mode (16x16 pixel). how ever it is unique (up leveled clock logo)

**Option 2**

![postimage50](/assets/images/2025-10/logoshape3.jpg)
[second logo ideas](/assets/images/2025-10/logoshape3.jpg){: .center-image }

a standard clock with checkmark logo. Super Simple (compared to the first option) and should be easier to remebered by users as kapanrilis platform core feture is reminder platform for hobby related content.

&mdash; reminder is identic with clock and checklist.

**Option 3**

![postimage50](/assets/images/2025-10/logoshape4.jpg)
[thrid logo ideas](/assets/images/2025-10/logoshape4.jpg){: .center-image }

similar with the concept of option 1, elevated clock. Unqiue, it leveling up the generic clock icon. Probably little harder to be remembered because it has alot of shape make the logo become complex.

**Option 4**

![postimage50](/assets/images/2025-10/logoshape5.jpg)
[Fourth logo ideas](/assets/images/2025-10/logoshape5.jpg){: .center-image }

a crescent moon with clockwise. a classy icon.

**Option 5**

![postimage50](/assets/images/2025-10/logoshape6.jpg)
[Fifth](/assets/images/2025-10/logoshape6.jpg){: .center-image }

No direct clock nor calendar element, however the hedgedog hair is somehow represent clock. 

# The Decision

![postimage50](/assets/images/2025-10/logoshape4.jpg)

after taking several consideration,  option 3 will taken as the logo creation input on convential vector image editor due to following reason:
1. Kapanrilis core services is reminder to its user when their hobby related content is upcoming. These feature super identic with clock
2. elevated clock logo, it create uniqueness compared to the generic logo
3. not as complex as first option. during the actual logo creation at vector image editor, the logo might be edited into more simpler.

note: the kapanrilis text wont be considered, it will be replaced by another font family.
