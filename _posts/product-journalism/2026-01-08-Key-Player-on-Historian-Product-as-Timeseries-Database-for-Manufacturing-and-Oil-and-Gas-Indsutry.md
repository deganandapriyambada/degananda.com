excerpt: nowdays OT and IT are slowly emerging and integrated. However, the key vendor for each area remain the same. IT giant like microsoft, google or AWS are not the key player on operation technology area. 
tags: historian operation-technology
background: Data is the key for any operation or production optimization. One of critical data for analysis is production data that commonly came from the machine. Historian software can fetch data from DCS or SCADA and store it on timeseries database.
objective: to understand the key vendors on operation technology (OT) market especially on the plant historian software.

Data Historian is a specialized time series database for industrial data in operational technology (OT) environment. In the context of operation technology (OT), historian is used to **capture & store** large volums of production data, process data and operation. These data are generated by equipment or machine that reside on the shopfloor.

Data historian will be placed at site level in order to say closed to the shopfloor system such as SCADA/PLCs/ICSS/DCS and often sit on DMZ(demilitarized zone) network

For an organization with multiple production sites, multiple data historian will be rolled out per sites. These site level data historians are then **will be integrated into enterprise historian** which located at HQ (headquarter).

Leading five enterprise historian solution for both process and discrete manufacturing industry on the market are: **Aveva PI System** (formerly known as Osisoft PI system), **GE Proficy Historian**, **Yokogawa Exaquantum**, **Honeywell Uniformance** ( PHD/process hisotirian database) & Siemens(Simatic Process Historian).

Lets take a look how these solution can fit into enterprise historian key capabilities.

# Key Capabilities

Below are the key capabilities/feature criteria of a software that can be categorized into enterprise historian.

1. **Consume data from one or more data historians** server securely and has bi-directional controll access
2. **Non Instrusive Data Acquisition**, not distrupting safety/operation/production. Any kind of Data retrieval such as event, alarm, production data, process data or operational data from data historian into enterprise historian must not distrupt with existing control or safety system
3. **Data exchange between enterprise data historian with surroundings application** or consumer through various protocol
4. Production/operational data **contextualization** with **asset information**
5. Production/operational data **contextualization** with **operational/downstream workflow information** 
6. **Data validation** (basic validation such as value range & format)for any incoming production or operational data (event/alarm) to the enterprise historian from data historian.
7. **Data governance** (data ownership, stewardship, role based access control, platform based access control)
8. **Buffered data transmission** system during data connectivity issues to ensure no data losses
9. **Disaster recovery system**
10. Integration support with leading **IT-OT convergence protocol such as OPC-UA** alongside with the buffering mechanism
11. **Deployable at lvl 4 network** and capable to **connect securely with data historian at level 3**. Aligned with ISA95 architecture
12. **Store and manage structured data**(time-stamped and numerical data from SCADA/PLCs/DCS/MES) and **semi-structured data** (eg: sensor data with flexible attribute). Well known data format to handle semi structured data is JSON.
