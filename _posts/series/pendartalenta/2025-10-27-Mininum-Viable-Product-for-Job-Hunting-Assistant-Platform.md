# Quater Life Crysis on Youth
 
For some people, career growth is one of their top priority, especially between their 20s(post collegue graduation) and 30s, consequenty created a **fierce competitive situation** during the **job hunting on the market**. For those who left  behind by their peers will often experiences quater life crysis. 

These kind of situation is escalated by overconsumed social media without a wise content filtering causing unreal life expectation which not match with their as is state (example: not coming from rich family, doesnt have top tier education, physical limitation, etc).

In order to escape the "FOMO" (a feeling that left behind), a realistic and measureable career growth plan need to be planned with self awareness (understannd his/her strong point, skill and weakness).

## The Resolution

a career means different to each person. On white collar cases, a little portion of population is pursuing enterpreneurship, while some are comfortable with chasing corporate jobs.

however, its not rare that people also chasing their dream as blue collar worker. For example, someone who love to drive and operating a vehicle, might take blue collar job such as driver, heavy machine operating and so on.

    no definitive reason to make a job is better than other job. it all goes down to the each person perspective, priority and preferences.

&mdash; but does setting up proper career trajectory based on **personal career preferences** is enough to escape FOMO and quarter life crysis?

the general answer is **NO** (backed up by several research) such as :

1. The Influence of Fear of Missing Out terhadap Quarter Life Crisis for Final Year Student (Ni Kadek Su Wardaniorcid ,  Nani Barorah Nasution  orcid | 2025)
2. Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) & Psychological Distress (Soraci P | 2025)

## Completely get rid of quater life crysis and life FOMO

**Self Awareness** is the strongest **antidotes** to these virus (FOMO & Quater life crysis)

a message to only the readers, but also for myself as the writer..

It is important to understand our strength, weakness, values and priorities. Once these factor are identified and **accepted**, we will **live on top of our own shoes and be proud** of whatever career achievement, realtionship achievement or even social level. **Everyone start from different starting point**!. Hence we should never compared outself with others, becoming a realistics human being 

**a person is not defined by their career!.**

## Human Life Metrics are Beyond from Career Achievement

there are alot of aspects other than career in live which is shape a person identity.

The metric to assess our life achievement should NOT be captured from career only.

- emotionaly maturity
- spirituality
- physical health
- mental health
- quality of friendship
- social constribution

&mdash; however, these metrics need a fundamental factor which is: **Realistic financial stability** (enough to enjoy modest life and based on self awareness of strength, weakness and potential! )

to achieve the realistic financial stability, we must keep growing(on all aspects) and never surrender.
