background: High tech devices (which usually expensive) that rely on the use of battery is need an extra protection to ensure it work properly most of the time. Customer paid a lot of money to buy those high tech devices.
objective: To create NEO4J Graph data model to create an agenticAI that can detect and determine battery problem.

# GraphDB Relationship Model to Detect Battery Fault Root Causes

## The Importance of Data for Electronic Devices Reliability

Nowdays, Electronic devices such as Electric vehicle (EV), high end consumer electroic until OBD2 Dongle (to read car canBus data) are mostly capable of detecting fault code on various level.

At the bare minimum it can tell the user whether the devices is ready to be used or not. Usually there is a LED indicator to show the devices status.

    Battery faults or failures in the industry are a significant problem, especially in sectors relying on batteries for energy storage, transportation, or electronics. Unreliable product can end up in customer dissatisfaction.

Meanwhile, from the manufacturer side, fault detection is used not to only detecting devices readiness (status) but to trace any problem on the battery. From the material issue, chemical issue until battery vendor selection issue.

Without knowing what is happening to the battery, devices manufacturer might ended up losing its shape on the market due to following reason:

1. **Competitive and high satrated market**: Bunch of player compete on the electronics goods. Battery data is critical to win the competition. Without data, GTM strategy can't be crafted.
2. **Rapid Technology Innovation**: From Edge analytics to AgenticAI. Any company that not adapt to the cutting edge technology will lost its competitive advantage. Battery data can be used to improve many process from supply chain, production until customer services.
3. **Product Quality**: a reliable product is preferrable product. There is no way that electronic devices manufacturer can improve their **product reliability** if the product cannot  "speak" (generate data) for future improvement. Tight competition will favor on the customer benefit to choose best product over competitive pricing which usually won by player that can innovate and adapt to the changes.
