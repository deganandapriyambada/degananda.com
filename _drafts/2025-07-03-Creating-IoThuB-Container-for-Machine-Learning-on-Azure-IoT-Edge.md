excerpt: Prepare and Deploy Custom Azure IoT Edge module for Machine Learning using Tensorflow
tags: azure iot-edge
topics: azure
ptype: News
background: Analytics or computation can be done in OT and IT(Cloud) environment. Small computer like raspberry pi, nvidia jetson or ardunio are powerful enough (with proper specs) to run small to medium sized model. Meanwhile the heavylifting for huge ML Model will   still need to be ran on cloud. Those flexibility will help to reduce cost, optimize the latency and streamlined the data computation between edge and cloud.
objective: to create custom Azure IoT Edge Container for machine learning using tensor flow. Deployment will be fully automated using Azure CLI and Azure IoT Edge Deployment manager.
