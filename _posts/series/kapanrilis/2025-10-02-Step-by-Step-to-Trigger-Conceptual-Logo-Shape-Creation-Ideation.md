## Decide Logo Shape Type

There are four kind of logo shape type

- **TextOnly** - among these industry reference only CinemaXXI, giladiskon and myanimelist are using textOnly logo. Others industry references has their own logo shape which represent their platform/brand
- **LetterMark** - TextOnly but with abbreviations. CinemaXXI, Giladiskon and Myanimelist favicon are using this approach as favicon has limited spaces. however, the icon it self is full textOnly. Eventhough these platform only use text as their logo, it still has quite noticeable distinction as their logo font-family is **unique**.
- **Symbol** - MAL, Jakarta-Tourism, TaTap, Stream and Eventbrite are using symbol as their logo. One thing that noticeable is: their symbol is unqiue, the writer never find same (or even similar) logo with other platforms. First take a way: logo should be **unique** to the platform to ensure the customer remember it.
- **Combination of Logo + Text** - EventBrite is combining logo shape with the text.

&mdash; Conclusion: There is no definitive standard practice whether a logo should has symbol nor text. As long as the logo is **unique**, easy to remember by customer and can **spark the platform personality** it should be good enough. 

**for kapanrilis.com cases** : an emerging platform (start-up) most likely has combination of symbol and text as the logo. Kapannrilis.com will will also follow same thought process as they should came up with such decision after long research and for sure backed up by science.  

Combining text and logo will increase the likelyhood of customer remembering the platform as it has two unique element(logo and text) and generally image is easy to be remembered compared to text.

## Brainstorming the Visual Methapor

below are visual references from these hobby related platform and our interpretation

1. Stream - two dots that connected with lines. it tried to convey the connectedness between gamers (first dot) and publishers (second dot)
2. Myanimelist - straight forward text, high confidence with their brand as MAL is the leading platform for anime and manga.
3. 21cineplex - text with unique italic typography. Market leaders on indonesia for cinema.
4. eventbrite - looks like a road on uphill mountain with orange color. It feel like any typical startup would combine unique logo, brand colour and text
5. jakartatourism - the logo is designed with several jakarta's perks. for example it logo is shaped after iconic monas (national monument) that located at the heart of jakarta. It tried to express the authenticity of the platform as it promotes local tourism.
6. GilaDiskon - straight forward text. similar with MAL. Not sure if it is market leader, but these platform with textonly logo show their confidence

**Key take away:**

- market leader platform tend to only use textOnly as logo. while, emerging platform (startup) will combining both logo and text to add additional chance for the customer to remember them.
- startup company is heavy invested by customer. They have super agile and fast paced working environments. the logo creation / design must be created after **long process of research and branchstorming**. there must be a science reason that backed up on why start up platform tend to combine logo and text. As a emerging platform, this should be the standard.

below are some visual methaphor that looks like suitable for kapanrilis.com platform offering (reminder for hobby related content release and scheduling integration to the user calendar)

- Reminder/notifictions is identic with following shape silhoute : bell, calendar. megaphone, lighting bold(not directly identic, rare occassions), papper airplane.
- scheduling is identic with : calendar, clock, diary, checklist
- the content managed on kapanrilis is hobby. it is a personal, not formal and the vibe ideally should be fun it could be : cloud that represent calendar, and star which represent the bell/alarm.
