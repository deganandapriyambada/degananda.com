# What make this series start ?

After working at a consulting company for almost 9 years, I started to realize that i have wide span of experiences and skill across different role, but unfortunately none of them are depth enough.

> they said: we just a All in one hammer. Jack of All Trade **master of None**

&mdash; Front end developer, PMO, Project Manager, Business analyst, Scrum Master, Backend Developer, Data Engineer, DS, UI/UX, Architect, Cloud/Infra Engineer, Devops, Tech Advisory, Tester.



## The After Math

Having wide exposure to variety of role comes with advantages and disadvantages. 

Lately, i felt that the disadvantages overpowering and overshadowing the advantage of being a generalist on software engineering area.

The lack of depth on one particular field created an immersive depressing situation. a Feeling being left behind by our par which has depth skill on particular field (eg: 10 years work as android engineer).

> In the end, it cause insecurity.

## Resolution

Like a drama movie, every conflict need to be followed by resolution. 

> To overcome the insecurity, the main root cause need to be solved by gaining depth are specific field through re0learning program.

&mdash; **The Plan:**

1. Selecting Specific pair of field. I Feel that Single field experise wont create a specialization. it need to be combined with at least one additional field to complete the specialization.
2. **Programming is the foundation**. Hence, this field will always included.
3. Create weekly learning plan
4. Document the learning plan by write it on this website (pipenpoof).
5. Following up elon musk's strategy to handle context switching: <q> One Field per Day </q>. 
6. Over 6 Month period with weekly learning plan.

&mdash; **The decision**

  I will choose a pair of field that represent my strong point.

- Specific Pair of Field: **Cloud Infra Engineer** & **Data Engineer**
- Programming Language: Matured=> **NodeJS**, **Python**, **Dart** & **Java** + Emerging => **Rust** & **GO**

Here we go, lets start.
