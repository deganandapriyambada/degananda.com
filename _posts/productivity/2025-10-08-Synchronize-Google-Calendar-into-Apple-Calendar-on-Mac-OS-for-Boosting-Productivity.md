# The Importance of Synchronizing Personal and Work Email

Managing multiple calendar can affect daily productivities rate as some **agenda might be missed/unnoticed** because typically work schedule is managed on **work email**, while personal schedule such as family matter, personal learning or even vacation plan are stored on **personal email.**

It is advised to synchronize both of these schedule into single calendar.

    However, some work email account has strict restriction on the calendar sharing.

If company policy limiting the calendar sharing, then there is no other choice but to still managing multiple calendar for work and personal schedule.

# Synchronizing Google Calendar to Apple Calendar

Fortunately, apple calendar has built it feature to synchronize google calendar with apple calendar schedule without the needs of any 3rd party application.

## Add Google as Service Provider

go to apps launcher on mac and type calendar, then click the calendar.app

Choose Google as the account provider. (note: adding other calendar provider is also possible as long as the provider name shown under apple calendar settings.)

for better mac performance, only tick the calendar apps integration. Because mac native email client will ran on background if it is activated by binding any email service account. Just use the browser email client.

&mdash; it is advised to not set the synchronization interval too freqently as it will increase memory consumption and speed up the battery consumption as well.
