# Relevancies between Quater Life Crysis and FOMO on Youth
 
For some people, career growth is one of their top priority, especially between their 20s(post school/college graduation) and 30s, consequenty created a **fierce competitive situation** during the **job hunting on the market**. For those who left  behind by their peers will often experiences quater life crysis. 

These kind of situation is escalated by overconsumed social media without a wise content filtering causing unreal life expectation which not match with their as is state (example: not coming from rich family, doesnt have top tier education, physical limitation, etc).

In order to escape the "FOMO" (a feeling that left behind), a realistic and measureable career growth plan need to be planned with self awareness (understannd his/her strong point, skill and weakness).

## The Resolution to Stop QLC

Career means different to each person. On white collar cases, a little portion of population is pursuing enterpreneurship, while some are comfortable with chasing corporate jobs.

however, its not rare that people also chasing their dream as blue collar worker. For example, someone who love to drive and operating a vehicle, might take blue collar job such as driver, heavy machine operating and so on.

    no definitive reason to make a job is better than other job. it all goes down to the each person perspective, priority and preferences.

&mdash; but does setting up proper career trajectory based on **personal career preferences** is enough to escape FOMO (**fear of missing out**) and quarter life crysis?

the general answer is **NO** (backed up by several research) such as:

1. The Influence of Fear of Missing Out terhadap Quarter Life Crisis for Final Year Student (Ni Kadek Su Wardaniorcid ,  Nani Barorah Nasution  orcid, 2025)
2. Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) & Psychological Distress (Soraci P,  2025)

## Completely get rid of quater life crysis and life FOMO

FOMO can't be fully prevented due to the human nature (greed), but it can be managed and converted into positive energy.

<hr >

**Self Awareness** is the strongest **antidotes** to these virus (FOMO & Quater life crysis)

a message to only the readers, but also for myself as the writer..

It is important to understand our strength, weakness, values and priorities. Once these factor are identified and **accepted**, we will **live on top of our own shoes and be proud** of whatever career achievement, realtionship achievement or even social level. **Everyone start from different starting point**!. Hence we should never compared outself with others, becoming a realistics human being 

**a person is not defined by their career!.**

## Human Life Metrics are Beyond from Career Achievement

there are alot of aspects other than career in live which is shape a person identity.

The metric to assess our life achievement should NOT be captured from career only.

- emotionaly maturity
- spirituality
- physical health
- mental health
- quality of friendship
- social constribution

&mdash; however, these metrics need a fundamental factor which is: **Realistic financial stability** (enough to enjoy modest life and based on self awareness of strength, weakness and potential! )

to achieve the realistic financial stability, we must keep growing(on all aspects) and never surrender.

# Milestoneku Platform

&mdash; Milestoneku.com is a digital spine for your life growth (productivity platform)

as a SaaS(software as a services) platform, milestoneku has three pilar of capabilities to support the user to survive on 21st century where information is fully opened to anyone through internet (globalization).

1. Productivity Milestone
2. Health Milestone
3. Wellness Milestone

Each pilar is designed to support user to plan, schedule, monitor and track day to day target (milestone) in order to achieve balanced life style and eventually could stay away from FOMO (fear of missing out).

&mdash; lets breakdown how each pilar can fortify ourself by enhancing self awareness and consciousness from the threat of FOMO as it can lead into depression & low self esteem. 

## Productivity Milestone

Scientific research shows that **FOMO is killing human productivity level**.

    FoMO is closely related to SNS(social networking sites) use and has negative effects on academic performance.
    
The effects of problematic internet usage (PIU) and responding to frequent notifications entails repeated switching between tasks. 
    
&mdash; This affects attention interrupts work and overall productivity

sources: Alt D. Students’ Wellbeing, Fear of Missing out, and Social Media Engagement for Leisure in Higher Education Learning Environments. Curr Psychol. 2018;37:128–138

In other words, apart from reducing social media consumption, FOMO symptom can also be **surpressed by having high productivity level**.

theoritically, lack of productivity can lead into the urge to open social media, but of course should be enabled along side with goodwill/strong intetion to limit social media consumption.

below is the strategy to **increase productivity** level to kill FOMO.

- set clear, viable and tangible (can be measured through quantitative approach) goals on career development (any collar!)
- structurized career path. while the outcome of human effort has a lot of factor which sometimes are uncontrollable, career path can be defined and planned properly (its okay if the realization !== planned, human has ability to adapt and improve overtime)
- to always feel content & proud with our own achievement by defining personal version of success. Because it is differ per human being as every baby born with different starting point, privilages and condition! 

### User Story Mapping

user stories will be written using following common format on the software engineering industries:

    as a <persona>, i want <perform the action>, so that <benefit for the personal>

these productivity strategy is translated into following user stories:

| # | Epic| User Stories |

## Physical Health Milestone

"a world can turn upside down once human got a chronic or terminal disease."

once we got such disease, our view of the world will be changed, and often to take everything for granted. 

sometimes, we forgot about the natural happiness which naturally given from the creator, as simple as able to see the world without any vision defect, able to breath, able to walk & able to jump.

many scientist conclude that the routine done by human especially on their **30s will significantly affect** the physical and mental health (longetivity) in their 40s, 50s and beyond.

&mdash; it is important to always be grateful with the creator natural gift (vision, ability to move, etc).

and the best action to show the gratitude is by **perserve the health** it self.

there are at least four health related matter which should be planned, scheduled and tracked every day

1. sleep
2. nutrition
3. rest
4. physical exercise

apart from perserving human health, these combination of activity will reduce FOMO symtoms because they influence dophamine production from body (happiness hormore) which surpass the urge to open social media as generally people open social media to get happy (entertaiment).

another benefit of health related activity adherence is lowering the reactiveness towards social media post which often lead into negative emotion (angry, hate, envy).
