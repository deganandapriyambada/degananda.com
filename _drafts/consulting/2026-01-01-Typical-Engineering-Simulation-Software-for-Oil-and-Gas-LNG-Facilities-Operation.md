Process simulation on oil and gas LNG facilities must be performed during FEED(front-end engineering design) phase and operational.

FEED process simulation must focus on designing all of the engineering process across facilities starting from natural gas extraction from subsea all the way to the gas processing at onshore/off shore gas processing facilities **before building the facilities** to calculate CAPEX and choosing/validate process design, while process simulation during the operational stage are focusing on overall operation efficiency such as production optimization, maintenance, asset integrity etc **during the facilities operation**.

# Operational Simulation for Oil and Gas Facilities

There are four critical area which require extensive process simulation during operational stages to check simulate the plant/facilities behavior including production, energy, asset availability & HSSE with following angle: risk prevention, risk control and response readiness

Process simulation during operation stages is done using **data driven** approach to simulate the **near actual plant behavior**. Plant data that usually reside on historian will be fed into the simulation software and combined with business/operational information to perform the simulation.

Below are the typical process simulation that available on oil and gas facilities especially for LNG (liquified natural gas)

1. Process dynamics on FPSO/FPU
2. Process dynamics on OLNG
3. LNG liquifaction process simulation on OLNG
4. Flow simulation on SURF/subsea well
5. Carbon capture simulation
6. Integrated simulatino from FPSO and OLNG
7. Energy consumption and optimization simulation
8. Simulation integration with operational planning
9. Support various simulation model
10. Scaleable to process large volume of data
11. Low latency simulation to ensure timely decision making
12. Training simulation for operator
