    Logo is not just product symbol. It hold powerful brand identity which is the first thing that customer would perceive.

<hr />

There are three steps to craft powerful and meaningful product logo

1. Define **product/brand identity**
2. Understand the **best practice of designing a logo visualization**
3. **Craft the logo** based on product identity and current best practice of visualize a logo

# Brand Identity

a brand identity is any visible thing that related to the company/product/brand which can be seen and felt by customer during overall product or services experience. 

    There are several key component that composing brand identity. Usually, each component will be sharpened based on product/company funmendetal strategy. 

## Component

Below are the component that compose brand identity.

Business Component

1. Product Vision (strategical)
2. Product Mission (strategical)
3. Product Key objectives (tactical)

Visual Component (Derrived from business component)

1. Color
2. Design
3. Typography

Those combination (business + visual business identity component) will **impact on customer perception** towards on the product/brand.

Its important to strategize and craft brand identity before creating a logo to ensure the actual product's value can be delivered to the customer.

## Vision (Strategical)

[Vision -> Mission -> Key Objectives -> KPI -> Day to day execution](/assets/images/2025-06/logo1.jpg){: .center-image }

    where we going to be in the next ten years.

Vision is like long term goal for the product/company. Imagine, how the product will benefit society in next five to ten years. a Vision is beyond tangible commercial product growth such as revenue, user base, profit, etc. Its more on the **social impact**. 

<u><b>Key consideration to create product vision</b></u>

1. Social impact over business growth
2. Impress and motivate all stakeholder to grow the product.
3. Make sense. Because vision need to be mapped into measurable mission. Otherwise it will only create utopia.

## Mission (Strategical)

    what need to be done to achieve the vision.

Mission is a company/product direction to achieve the vision. 

<hr />

## Target Audience

Before mission derrived into objective, a target audience is need to be defined. a Mission can only be success for specific target audience whom met the business criteria especially regarding the purchase intention.

a good mission with inproper target audience will guarantee failure beaucse the audience problem is not match with the mission purposes.  Unmatch audience and mission resulting in unsolved audience's problem.

## Objective (Tactical+Measureable)

    How to achieve the mission based on target audience by giving value added to the customer.

In order to ensure the mission is achieveable, a key objective will be introduced based on product target audience and should focus on giving enermous (if possible) value added to customer

Objective will be derrived into **KPI** (Key performance indicator) for operational excellence purposes. KPI is a sets of target to measure objective progress.

100% KPI achievement ideally should reflect to the successfuly achieved business objectives. If its not aligned, a review on the KPI/objectives might need to be adressed to find the GAP.

 Finally, the team will execute day to day activities to met the KPI (**Operational level**).

# Color

Color is not just visual representation. It hold deep value when potential customer see it. Studies from <u>Elliot & Maier (2012</u>) conclude that color influence **mood and emotion**.  

Also another study from Labrecque & Milne 2013 mentioned that **color affect decision making**. Especially when making purchases.       

    Hence, picking brand color is critical for product branding and go to market strategy.

## Steps to choose brand color

pre requisite before choosing brand color

1. Product vision, mission and business objective 
2. (derrived from pre-requisite #1) Product proposition value (product feature or capability) is defined
3. Target audience (customer/user persona)

Match those three with suitable color pshycology to **increase the possiblity** of influcing potential customer **purchasing intention**.
