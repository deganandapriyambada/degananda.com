Performance in context of plant performance is sets of matrix which indicate how well the an asset is perform, measured by its efficiency, productivity, reliability, output quality and safety across all facilities.

Performance management is typically focus on following area **production optimization**, **asset integrity management**, **safety & environmental compliance**, r**eliability & maintenance**,  **key performance indicator monitoring across production**, **safety**, o**perational & maintenance**.

Modern platform often clump these performance monitoring in one platform because each area has similar solution approach which often called as **operational twin** (data-driven model to generate operational insight from centralized plant and operational data for certain operations area)

All required operational and process data are captured into datalake or one centralized database, then analytical process will be performed to extract the insight of each performance area.

Some key players on this area are Aspentech operational insight, Siemens XHQ, Aveva unified operation center,  Honeywell Forge Production Intelligence and Yokogawa Oprex Intelligent Manufacturing hub.

# Typical Focus Area for Plant Performance Measurement

Below are the typical process area that require digital plant performance management    

1. Unified production performance dashboard
2. Production and process erformahnce Benchmark towards the expected perfromance from the design
3. Performance KPI (Key per formance indicator)
4. Capture production loss
5. Detect performance degradation to enable early intervention (alert, notification)
6. Well & reservoir performance
7. Flow assurance performance
8. Detect equipment performance degradation benchmark with the expected performance before failure
9. End to end LNG (liquified natural gas) train perfromance
10. Energy perfromance for calculating efficiency loss
11. CCS Performance
12. Currate all operational, process and production data from surroundings apps
13. Incorporte maintenance, shift and production planning data during insight generation
14. role based reporting
15. performance review 
15. Track improvement action
16. Auditable performance report
