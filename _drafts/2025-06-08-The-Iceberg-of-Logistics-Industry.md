# Business Requirement

Path	Why It Fits You
Logistics Tech Specialist	You already have deep fleet experience + IoT skills; clients in retail, 3PLs, cold chains, or urban delivery startups would love this.
Smart Transportation Consultant	If you enjoy public infrastructure work (city, utility, sustainability), this is the next layer. Often tied to smart cities.
Manufacturing Tech Advisor	Since you just entered this space, it's valuable — but secondary unless you plan to pivot deep into operations.
