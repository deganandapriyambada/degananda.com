ðŸŽ¯ Categories of Design Patterns in OOP
1. Creational Patterns (how objects are created)
Factory Method â€“ delegates instantiation to subclasses.

Abstract Factory â€“ creates families of related objects without specifying exact classes.

Singleton â€“ ensures a class has only one instance.

Builder â€“ builds a complex object step by step.

Prototype â€“ copies an existing object instead of creating a new one from scratch.

2. Structural Patterns (how classes/objects are composed)
Adapter â€“ allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

Decorator â€“ adds behavior to an object dynamically.

Facade â€“ provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

Composite â€“ treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.

Bridge â€“ separates abstraction from implementation.

Proxy â€“ acts as a placeholder for another object.

Flyweight â€“ reduces memory usage by sharing objects.

3. Behavioral Patterns (how objects interact)
Observer â€“ notifies dependents when the subject changes.

Strategy â€“ selects an algorithm at runtime.

Command â€“ encapsulates a request as an object.

State â€“ allows an object to change behavior based on internal state.

Visitor â€“ separates operations from objects on which they operate.

Template Method â€“ defines the skeleton of an algorithm and lets subclasses fill in the steps.

Mediator â€“ centralizes communication between objects.

Iterator â€“ provides a way to access elements sequentially.

Chain of Responsibility â€“ passes a request along a chain of handlers.

Interpreter â€“ interprets a custom language or grammar.

Memento â€“ captures and restores an objectâ€™s state.
