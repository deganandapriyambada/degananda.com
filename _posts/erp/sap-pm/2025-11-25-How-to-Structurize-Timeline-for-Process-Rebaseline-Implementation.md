# Why process redesign often happened after digital transformation?

In many cases, an organization will soon realize that the new implemented business process on certain application is not optimal after a group of consultant/audit team found a process flaw during the system  after digital transformation go-live process is completed.

&mdash; Such condition can still be considered normal as long as **the discovered flaw not within the solution fundemental**, otherwise it might require fullbown software re-engineering.

Usually these people will propose to re-engineer the process and tried to stich out new workflow based on the solution fundamental standard/best practices within the application.

## Study Case on SAP PM

Top Four Most common flaw which not related to the application fundamental solution are:

1. The **feature is not intended to be use as it was designed**. For example, maintenance plan on SAP PM should use to project any maintenance activity which has some certain trigger (time based, performance based or the combination)
2. **missing integration**. Any first cut digital transformation will have to battle with tight timeline as it has to accomodate most of the leadership/stakeholder visioning resulting in some unncesary integration to be descoped as long as those integration can still be done manually as the work around. It will impacting the user QoL(Quality of life) when they operate the application.
3. **Decoupled reporting process**. If KPI(key performance indicator) is not well defined during the digital transformation project, it might cause user to create their own reporting which more align with their department goal causing unaligned process flow between SAP PM within actual day to day operation.
4. **Lack of non functional quality gate check**. Business user will likely use SAP PM for data input and hope to get good insight from it. However, a simple slowness of the application load time (from SAP PM or it surrounding) might annoy the user and cause a lot of problem (low data quality, frustation or worst cases, the apps is not going to be use by user as they opted to use coventional tools like excel file)

# The Resolution: Structurized Timeline to Address the Process Flaw

Assuming the application (in this case is SAP PM) fundamental / core solution is not changed and doesnt require full blown software re-engineering (re-coding/programming), a systematic timeline can be created in order implement process re-engineering on SAP PM.
