# The Importance of Data Quality Management for Maintenance Management on Industry

Transitioning from intuition driven to data driven operation is not easy. Many digital transformation is failed due to a many factors. One of the unseen factor is about data quality. This factor is usually overlooked as the organization too focused on the "to be process" improvements and then rely on the software capabilities.

&mdash;Â it is not as easy as flipping the plam of hand! Good concept & good software (such as SAP, Oracle, Hexagon, Etc) will ended up as garbage collector if the data input & output is not managed properly.

	Data governance and Master Data Management (MDM) are major technology enabler on the success rate of digital transformation.

without good data governance framework and integrated master data management, any ERP software for any modules (APM, Planning, scheduling) will produce a garbage (**Garbage in = garbage out**) as the ERP software will process garbage data in the beginning. Doesnt matter how sophisticated the software analytics, if the input is trash, then the analytics output will also be trash.
