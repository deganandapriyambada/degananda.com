# What make this series start ?

After working at a consulting company for almost 9 years, I started to realize that i have wide span of experiences and skill across different role, but unfortunately none of them are depth enough.

> they said: we just a All in one hammer. Jack of All Trade **master of None**

&mdash; Front end developer, PMO, Project Manager, Business analyst, Scrum Master, Backend Developer, Data Engineer, DS, UI/UX, Architect, Cloud/Infra Engineer, Devops, Tech Advisory, Tester.



## The After Math

Having wide exposure to variety of role comes with advantages and disadvantages. 

Lately, i felt that the disadvantages overpowering and overshadowing the advantage of being a generalist on software engineering area.

The lack of depth on one particular field created an immersive depressing situation. a Feeling being left behind by our par which has depth skill on particular field (eg: 10 years work as android engineer).

> In the end, it cause insecurity.

## Resolution

Like a drama movie, every conflict need to be followed by resolution. 

> To overcome the insecurity, the main root cause need to be solved by gaining depth are specific field through re0learning program.

&mdash; **The Plan:**

1. Selecting Specific pair of field. I Feel that Single field experise wont create a specialization. it need to be combined with at least one additional field to complete the specialization.
2. **Programming is the foundation**. Hence, this field will always included.
3. Create weekly learning plan
4. Document the learning plan by write it on this website (pipenpoof).
5. Following up elon musk's strategy to handle context switching: <q> One Field per Day </q>. 
6. Over **6 Month** period with weekly learning plan.

&mdash; **The decision**

  I will choose a pair of field that represent my strong point.

- Specific Pair of Field: **Cloud Infra Engineer** & **Data Engineer**
- Programming Language: Matured=> **NodeJS**, **Python**, **Dart** & **Java** + Emerging => **Rust** & **GO**
- Field Area: IoT/IT-OT
- Architectural Style: Cloud based with Modern-Enterprise Style Technology Architecture

## Use Cases

To ensure the learning journey is understandable from start to end, all the posted article related to this series will be tied with following use cases:

| Property | Value  | 
|----|----------|
| Project Name  | Mini Smart Weather Station on the House   | 
| Main Use Cases  | Generate, Acquire and Create Insight Temperature and Humidity telemetry Data  | 
| User Story#1 | as a house resident, i would like to see humidity and temperature level on my house so that i adjust my daily routine (eg: food, clothes, activities, mask, etc)  | 
| User Story#2 | as a house resident, i would like to be able to register my house on the system so i can view it interactively on maps | 
| User Story#3 | as a house resident, i would like to be suggested with my daily routines (eg: food, clothes, activities, mask, etc) depend on the humidity and temperature condition  | 
| User Story#4 | as a house resident, i would like to have an assistant agent that able to give me warning on harsh temperature or humidity and able to put neccesary items on my choosen ecommerce basket.  | 
| User Story#5 | as a house resident, i would like to manage the assistant agent which can help me put neccesary item to my ecommerce basket base knowledge and set the budgeting control.  | 
| User Story#5 | as a house resident, i would like to have my own weather prediction (humidity and temperature) based on my house telematics data  |
