excerpt: Asset management process output benchmark is generally easier to understand, compared with process based benchmark.  Its comparing document to document (physical or digital) on across all processes.

background: Asset Management Operating Model consist three elements (Actor, Process and Output). Process output has well defined criteria because its presented as physical or digital form. It has a quantifable visualization. unlike actor and process which reside on grey area. They are debateable considering to the organization culture and principle.
objective: to understand ideal asset management process output (document or form) and compare with realistic asset management process on the ground.

Based on some best practices, There are five key process of asset management. 

1. Maintenance Strategy Definition
2. Equipment Strategy Defintiion
3. Maintenance Planning & Scheduling
4. Maintenance Sourcing & Contractor Management
5. Maintenance Execution

Each process has several sub-process which detailed the key processes and output documents per sub-processes. 

    a Document flow can easily represent end to end of asset management business process as it is tangible and physically accessible.

# Process Output Comparison

Comparison is conducted using typically available document on the ground. Which are then compared with required document mentioned on the ideal assset management operating model.

It might not represent full fit-gap analysis on the process, but it will give helicopter view of the gap and relatively less effort compared to fullbown process-to-process gap analysis.
