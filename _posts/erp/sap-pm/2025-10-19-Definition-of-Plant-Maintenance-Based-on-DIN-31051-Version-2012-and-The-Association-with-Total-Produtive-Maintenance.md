excerpt: All process on the industry shall follow a standard to minimize the risk of executing operation that may disturpt the operation safety or effectiveness. Plant maintenance process has been standardized by german intitute of standarization in DIN 31051 which was renewed on 2012.

topics: asset-management
background: organization perception towards maintenance is shifted from time to time. Maintenace used to be labeled as cost center, in contrast to that, nowdays many organization put maintenance as one of their top budget prioritization on every fiscal year due to the value that can be bring by mainteannce process.
objective: to understand the latest plant maintenance standard based on DIN31051

# Total Production Maintenance & Plant Maintenance

TPM which stands for total productive maintenance is maintenance strategy which involve all employee from any divison or departemen to ensure zero production downtime due to equipment rediness by achieving **zero unplanned breakdown** ,**100% equipment readiness(outside turnaround/overhaul)** and **no unscheduled outages**.

&ndash; TPM is the evolution of reactive maintenance. TPM can be achived by following DIN31051 which define **plant maintenance standard**

## Definition of Plant Maintenance

based on DIM31051:2012-09 standard released by german institute of standarization, plant maintenance is defined by four main  **activities or task**: 1.inspection, 2.maintenance, 3.repair and 4.improvement to ensure to prevent equipment breakdown and maintain equipment readiness.

    some organization uses different plant maintenance measurement such as: inspection, maintenance, monitoring and testing

despite the different terminology, both definition has same purpose (avoid breakdown and maintain equipment readoness).

# Definition of maintenance

maintenance is all combination of administrative, technical and management activities throughout the life cycle of an equipment or unit to ensure the equipment readiness by perserving its functionality and restoring the equipment function into usable state (repair) so that it wont distrupt the prodution throughput.

apart from equipment readiness(high availability), total productive maintenance will also has focus on perserving the safety level of the machine, especially when an operator operate the machine.

## Inspection Task List

the technical condition of equipment availability and safety can only be measured through **regular inspection** and **regular monitoring**.

DIN31051 standard (2012) determine the purpose of inspection activity as a regular inspection which need to be executed in order to determine **technical condition of the equipment**.

apart from the technical equipments condition, once the technical condition is measured and known, **a follow up maintenance task will be scheduled**.

there are five inspection task as per DIN31051

1. Checking
2. Measurement
3. Observation
4. Assessment
5. Deriving consequences

## Maintenance Task List

based on DIN 31051 standard (2012), mainteannce activities is aimed to **delay the degradation of equipment functionality** as slow as possible by maintaining certain machine's parameter above minimum standard required by the machine OEM.

in order to achieve these goal, a **planned maintenance task execution adherence** need to be observed as company goal or KPI(key performance indicator). Following are the list of **inspection task** based on DIN31051:

1. visual inspection
2. adjustment
3. repalcement
4. supplement
5. lubrication
6. perservation
7. clean
8. functional testing

based on above DIN 31051 standard, some organization alter the definition the plant maintenance into: 1.inspection, 2.monitoring, 3.maintenance and 4.testing as the standard task list for inspection and maintenace are also including testing and monitoring.

these 8 maintenance task standard fron DIN31051 need to be executed regularly to achieve high level of equipment availability and safety.

&ndash; the **how-to perform** the inspection/maintenance task should based on OEM/manufacturer guidance.

## Repair Task List

Based on DIN 31051, repair task is including all neccesary task which aimed to restore the functionality of an faulty equipment (acceptable equipment's faulty level which can still be treated as "normally function" should based on OEM/manufacturer guidance) back to normal via maintenance and repair.

as per DIN 31051 there are three task of repair:

1. Unit exchange
2. Restoration of function
3. Breakdown resolution.

## Improvement

based on DIN31051, the last plant maintenance activities is **improvement process**. it combine all technical, administrative and management task that can improve the reliability, mainteanability or safetyness of the equipments without altering the original function (should still be functional as usual after improvement or modification)

there are four key improvement target as per DIN31051:

1. elimination of weak points
2. improvement in machinery and plant design
3. optimized business process
4. acceleration of the exchange of information.


# ISO Standard

Apart from the DIN31051, a recent standard from ISO 55000, 55001, 55002 which was published back then on 2024, introduce three new standard on asset management

&mdash; however, ISO standard is broader than DIN31051 where as DIN31051 focus on plant maintenance and ISO 55000 is focused on asset management in general.

an official publication company called SAP-Press which is a joint company between SAP and other firms state that DI31051 is the baseline of SAP PM(plant maintenance)

## ISO 55000

govern the correlation and relationship between asset management and management system

## ISO 55001

describe the critical parameter or requirement for asset management system.

## ISO 55002

determine the pre-requisite before implementing asset management system and it success factor
